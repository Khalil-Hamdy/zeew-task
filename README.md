# zeew-task
Redesign and implement one of the key mobile app screens from the Zeew Food Delivery Marketplace app. We're looking for someone who can design a clean, modern user experience and build it using native mobile code — while leveraging AI tools as part of their creative and development process.


#part 1
Design Decisions:
I redesigned Zeew’s experience with a clean layout, soft colors, and consistent spacing. Key sections like deals, categories, and stores are visually separated for easier navigation. Product cards are optimized for quick interaction, and the cart page focuses on clarity and ease of checkout.

AI Tools Used:

Uizard: For generating the initial UI using AI prompts.

Figma: For refining spacing, alignment, and building the interactive prototype.

ChatGPT: Helped structure components and generate design ideas.

UX Improvements:

Clear visual hierarchy for faster scanning.

Thumb-friendly touch areas.

Smooth flow from browsing to ordering.

Responsive and intuitive design for all screen sizes
